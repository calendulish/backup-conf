# Example file for configuration of backup-conf
#

# COMMENTS:
#
# This file accepts comments with hashtags. E.g.:
# Hello~wooo, i'm a comment.
#

# Special Váriables
# You can define a special variable for change the diff tool
# A variable looks like this: #?variable. See below:
#?DIFFPROGRAM /usr/bin/diff

# HOW TO USE:
#
# Each line support the specification of one file.
# E.g.:
/etc/backup-conf.conf
# The line above will backup the backup-conf into:
# <CURRENT_FOLDER>/etc/backup-conf.conf
# The folder structure will be ever the same on the system.
# Except for files into /home/<user>, these files will be
# backed up into: <CURRENT_FOLDER>/HOME/
# (you can use $HOME variable, it will be expanded to /home/<user>)
#
# -------------------------------------------------------------------

# TIPS:
#
# For backup all files into an folder, use a syntax like this:
# `find <folder> -type f` (don't forget the '`')
# All symlinks will be ignored.
# For more info about how it's work, read the find command man page.
#
# NOTE: `<command>` only work if the result of command is a list of
# absolute paths, one per line. (and when say "result", i mean a output in stdout.)
#
# This is all
